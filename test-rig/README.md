# NeonFS QEMU test rig

Spin up one or more throwaway VMs, attach raw disk images as NeonFS drives,
install `neonfs_omnibus` from `.deb` packages built out of this repository, and
form a cluster — end to end, with one command.

This exercises the **real install path** an operator follows on bare metal: a
base OS, the `.deb` packages, the `neonfs-omnibus` systemd unit, and the
`neonfs` CLI driving `cluster init` / `drive add` / `volume create`. It is
deliberately separate from the in-BEAM `:peer` integration tests
(`neonfs_integration`), which test code, not packaging or the on-host runtime.

## Quick start

```bash
cd test-rig
./neonfs-rig up                 # single-node cluster (default)
./neonfs-rig status
./neonfs-rig cli 1 -- volume list
./neonfs-rig ssh 1              # shell into node 1
./neonfs-rig down               # stop the VM(s)
./neonfs-rig clean              # stop and delete all runtime state
```

Multi-node:

```bash
NODES=3 ./neonfs-rig up         # 3 core nodes, replicas=3
```

Standalone interface-node join (#1163 — the #1139 acceptance):

```bash
./neonfs-rig up                 # bring up a cluster first
./neonfs-rig iface-join         # boot an interface-only VM and join it
```

`iface-join` boots an extra VM (index 9, `neonfs_nfs@10.10.10.19`) with
only `neonfs-common` + `neonfs-cli` + `neonfs-nfs` installed — no core —
joins it to the running cluster with `neonfs cluster join` (the CLI
drives the local NFS daemon, which performs the HTTP invite redemption
itself), then verifies the node is registered as an `nfs` service in
`node list`, that its NFS port serves, and that both survive a
`systemctl restart neonfs-nfs` with no manual intervention.

## Requirements

The rig needs QEMU and the cloud-init seed tooling on the host:

```bash
sudo apt-get install qemu-system-x86 qemu-utils cloud-image-utils
```

It also needs `nfpm` to build the `.deb` packages (only the first time, or
after a clean):

```bash
# pinned release, checksum-verified — see packaging/build-debs.sh
curl -fsSL -o /tmp/nfpm.tgz \
  https://github.com/goreleaser/nfpm/releases/download/v2.46.3/nfpm_2.46.3_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz
sudo tar -C /usr/local/bin -xzf /tmp/nfpm.tgz nfpm
```

### KVM acceleration (strongly recommended)

Without write access to `/dev/kvm` the VMs run under TCG software emulation,
which is **10–30× slower** — a single-node bring-up can take 20+ minutes
instead of ~2. Grant your user access via the `kvm` group (the device is
`root:kvm`, mode `0660`):

```bash
sudo usermod -aG kvm "$USER"     # then log out / back in, or: newgrp kvm
```

If the `kvm` group doesn't exist yet (some containers), create it matching the
device's GID first:

```bash
sudo groupadd -g "$(stat -c %g /dev/kvm)" kvm
sudo usermod -aG kvm "$USER"
```

The rig auto-detects a writable `/dev/kvm` and uses `accel=kvm` when available,
falling back to TCG otherwise.

## Commands

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `up` | Boot `NODES` VMs, install `neonfs_omnibus`, form the cluster, create a volume |
| `boot` | Boot + provision VMs only (no cluster init) |
| `init` | Initialise/join the cluster on already-provisioned VMs |
| `status` | Show VM state plus `cluster status` / `volume list` from node 1 |
| `ssh <n> [cmd...]` | SSH into node `<n>` (default 1) |
| `cli <n> -- <args>` | Run the `neonfs` CLI on node `<n>` |
| `bench` | Run the benchee benchmark suite against the running cluster (see below) |
| `bench-matrix` | Boot/bench/teardown across the standard cluster-config matrix (see below) |
| `down` | Stop all VMs, keep their disks |
| `clean` | Stop all VMs and delete runtime state (disks, seeds, ssh key) |

## Configuration

All knobs are environment variables (defaults in parentheses):

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `NODES` | `1` | Number of core VMs |
| `DRIVES_PER_NODE` | `2` | Extra disk images per node, each formatted + registered as a drive |
| `DRIVE_SIZE` | `2G` | Size of each extra disk image |
| `ROOT_SIZE` | `12G` | Virtual size of each node's root disk (grown from the base image) |
| `VM_MEM` | `2048` | RAM (MiB) per VM |
| `VM_CPUS` | `2` | vCPUs per VM |
| `REPLICAS` | `=NODES` | Replication factor for the system volume and the created volume |
| `CLUSTER_NAME` | `rig` | Cluster name |
| `VOLUME_NAME` | `test` | Name of the volume created at the end of `up` |
| `DIST_PORT` | `9100` | Pinned Erlang distribution port (`NEONFS_DIST_PORT`) |
| `SSH_BASE_PORT` | `2230` | Host port for node `n` SSH is `SSH_BASE_PORT + n` |

`REPLICAS` defaults to the node count so `volume create` is satisfiable without
`--allow-under-replicated` (NeonFS refuses a volume whose replication factor
exceeds the number of core nodes).

## How it works

1. **Base image** — Debian 13 (`genericcloud` amd64) qcow2, downloaded once into
   `.cache/images/`. Each node gets a copy-on-write overlay backed by it, grown
   to `ROOT_SIZE` (cloud-init `growpart` expands the root filesystem on boot).
2. **Packages** — `packaging/build-debs.sh` builds `neonfs-common`, `neonfs-cli`
   and `neonfs-omnibus` (plus the other service packages) into `.cache/debs/`.
3. **Disks** — `DRIVES_PER_NODE` raw images per node, attached as virtio block
   devices (`/dev/vdb`, `/dev/vdc`, …). cloud-init formats them `ext4` and mounts
   them at `/mnt/neonfs/drive1`, `/mnt/neonfs/drive2`, … cloud-init also installs
   `docker.io` and `containerd`, which back the container-runtime acceptance
   steps (the NeonFS Docker volume driver and the containerd content store).
4. **Networking** — two NICs per VM:
   - a user-mode (NAT) NIC for outbound internet + an SSH port forward to the host;
   - a socket/multicast NIC giving all VMs a shared L2 segment with static IPs
     (`10.10.10.1<n>`), used for inter-node Erlang distribution. No host bridge
     or root privileges required.
5. **Provisioning** (over SSH) — install the three `.deb`s, write
   `/etc/neonfs/neonfs.conf` (node name `neonfs@10.10.10.1<n>`, pinned
   `NEONFS_DIST_PORT`), `chown` the drive mountpoints to `neonfs`, and start
   `neonfs-omnibus`.
6. **Cluster** — node 1 runs `cluster init --drive /mnt/neonfs/drive1`; extra
   nodes `cluster join --via 10.10.10.11:9568` using an invite token; every node
   registers its remaining drives with `drive add`; finally a volume is created.

Node names are bare IPs (`neonfs@10.10.10.12`), so no DNS or `/etc/hosts` entries
are needed — `NeonFS.Epmd` feeds the IP straight to the resolver and learns each
peer's distribution port through the `--via host:9568` join handshake.

## Acceptance suite

`./acceptance` drives a **running** cluster through the full acceptance matrix —
cluster/drives/volume checks, FUSE, NFS, S3 and WebDAV operations,
cross-interface consistency, container-runtime integration, and (multi-node)
replication — reporting `PASS`/`FAIL`/`SKIP` per step and exiting non-zero if any
step fails.

The container-runtime steps exercise NeonFS as backing storage for Docker and
containerd:

- **Docker volume attach** — `docker volume create -d neonfs` provisions a
  NeonFS volume through the driver the omnibus package registers at
  `/etc/docker/plugins/neonfs.spec`, then `docker run -v` attaches it; writing
  in one container and reading it back in a second proves the volume is
  attached.
- **containerd content store** — a throwaway `containerd` configured with the
  NeonFS content proxy plugin (default store disabled) stores and retrieves an
  image-layer blob via `ctr content ingest`/`get`, landing it in the
  `containerd` NeonFS volume as a sharded `sha256` object.

Both steps `SKIP` rather than `FAIL` where their prerequisites are absent
(Docker/containerd not installed, the plugin socket not deployed, or no registry
connectivity to pull the test image).

```bash
./neonfs-rig up            # bring a single-node cluster up first
./acceptance single

NODES=3 ./neonfs-rig up     # or a multi-node cluster
./acceptance multi          # node count defaults to the running nodes
```

Each interface step writes uniquely-tagged files and consistency checks poll for
up to `CONSISTENCY_TIMEOUT` seconds (default 25) before failing, so async
propagation isn't mistaken for inconsistency. CLI calls are wrapped in
`CLI_TIMEOUT` (default 45 s). `KEEP=1` leaves the test mounts in place.

The suite is intended to fail loudly on real defects. Against the current build
it reports the cross-interface consistency failures (issue #1034) as `FAIL`, and
in `multi` mode the replication step exercises multi-node formation (issues
#1032 / #1033). Steps whose preconditions aren't met (e.g. replication on a
single node, or a volume that failed to create) are reported `SKIP`.

## Benchmarks

`./neonfs-rig bench` runs a [benchee](https://hex.pm/packages/benchee)-based
benchmark suite against a **running** cluster, driving real interface clients
over the rig's own SSH path — so it measures the packaged, distributed,
TLS-data-plane path rather than in-BEAM code paths. The harness is a small mix
project under `bench/` that runs on the rig host (needs Elixir/`mix`).

```bash
./neonfs-rig up            # bring a cluster up first
./neonfs-rig bench         # set up each interface, then benchmark
```

To benchmark a **specific revision** — e.g. stepping through the bisect range in
an auto-raised regression issue — pass `--rev`, which checks out, builds, and
boots that revision first (restoring your original ref afterwards), then emits
the same SHA-stamped results:

```bash
./neonfs-rig bench --rev <sha>   # no `up` needed; boots the revision itself
```

Auto-bisecting full-VM benchmarks is too slow, so bisect stays manual — `--rev`
just makes each step one command.

The wrapper sets up every **file-serving interface** it can on the running
cluster — FUSE, NFS, S3, WebDAV (reusing the acceptance suite's mount/credential
setup), plus the container-runtime interfaces Docker and containerd — and runs
the applicable operation set against each, driven the way `lib/acceptance.sh`
exercises it. Interfaces it can't set up are logged and skipped. Per
`(interface, operation)`:

| Operation | Reported | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `seq_write` | MB/s | large-file streaming write (`dd`/`PUT`, bounded buffer) |
| `seq_read` | MB/s | large-file streaming read |
| `small_files` | files/s | create/write/read/delete a batch — metadata-heavy |
| `stat_list` | ms/op | stat/HEAD + directory/bucket listing |
| `range_read` | ms/op | small random range read (skipped for S3 — `s3cmd` has no range GET) |

The **container-runtime** interfaces (#1533) run a reduced set against a warm
daemon the wrapper starts (so container/daemon-spawn cost isn't in the measured
op): **docker** benchmarks `seq_write`/`seq_read`/`small_files` via `docker
exec` inside a warm busybox container with the NeonFS volume attached (its data
path is FUSE underneath, so `stat_list`/`range_read` are skipped); **containerd**
benchmarks blob ingest (`seq_write`, a fresh unique blob each time) and get
(`seq_read`) against a warm throwaway containerd wired to the NeonFS content
proxy. Both skip (logged) when their runtime or plugin socket is absent.

### Cluster-config matrix

`./neonfs-rig bench-matrix` makes cluster configuration a benchmark axis: it
runs the suite across the standard set of cluster shapes, each a full
boot → bench → teardown cycle, so profiles are comparable across
configurations. Every run is tagged with its config label (in `meta.json` and
the result-dir name), on top of the `NODES`/`REPLICAS`/`DRIVES_PER_NODE` the
foundation already stamps.

| Config | `NODES` | `REPLICAS` | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `baseline` | 1 | 1 | floor — interface + core overhead, no remote placement |
| `durable` | 3 | 3 | realistic quorum-write config |
| `spread` | 3 | 1 | isolates remote-placement cost from replication cost |

```bash
./neonfs-rig bench-matrix   # no `up` needed — it boots/tears down each config itself
```

Erasure/compression/encryption/tiering are not rig env knobs yet, so they're not
matrix axes (deferred follow-up #1497).

### Scheduled runs

`.forgejo/workflows/bench.yml` runs `bench-matrix` weekly (and on
`workflow_dispatch`) on the KVM-capable `jeb` runner, uploading the
SHA-stamped results as a `bench-<sha>` artifact. It is **never** a PR-gating
job — full-VM benchmarks are too slow and load-sensitive to gate PRs.

Each run also applies a **regression gate**
(`NeonFS.Bench.Regression`): it fetches the last ~4 runs' artifacts, and per
`(config, interface, op)` flags any metric that moved the wrong way by **> 10%
and > 2σ** vs the rolling-window median (throughput/rate `ips` dropping,
latency rising). On a regression it opens an issue carrying the metric, the
median + σ, and a bounded `git bisect` range (`<oldest-in-window>..<current>`).
A regression opens an issue rather than failing the run — bisect stays manual
(`bench --rev`, #1525).

Every run writes its artifacts under `bench/results/<sha>-<timestamp>/`,
**stamped with the commit SHA and cluster config** it was produced from:

- `<sha>.json` / `<sha>.csv` — benchee's machine-readable output;
- `<sha>.html` — the benchee HTML report;
- `meta.json` — SHA, interfaces, `NODES`/`REPLICAS`/`DRIVES_PER_NODE`, big-file
  size, small-file count/size, and timestamp;

plus a printed per-`interface/op` summary.

Knobs (environment variables, in addition to the cluster ones above):

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `BENCH_VOLUME` | `bench` | Volume created + mounted/exported for the run |
| `BENCH_BIG_MIB` | `64` | Large-file size (MiB) for seq/range ops |
| `BENCH_FILE_COUNT` | `100` | Small files per benchmarked batch |
| `BENCH_FILE_SIZE` | `4096` | Bytes per small file |
| `BENCH_TIME` | `5` | benchee measurement time (seconds) |
| `BENCH_WARMUP` | `2` | benchee warmup time (seconds) |
| `BENCH_OUT` | `bench/results` | Output directory root |

## Troubleshooting

- **Boot/console**: each node's serial console is logged to
  `.cache/run/node-<n>/serial.log`.
- **`Could not access KVM kernel module: Permission denied`**: see *KVM
  acceleration* above, or accept the TCG fallback.
- **SSH never comes up**: check the serial log; cloud-init failures show there.
  `./neonfs-rig ssh <n> -- sudo cloud-init status --long` once reachable.
- **Daemon not answering the CLI**: `./neonfs-rig ssh <n> -- sudo journalctl -u neonfs-omnibus -n 100`.

### Multi-node note

The single-node path is the default and the most exercised. The multi-node join
path relies on node 1's cluster API (port `9568`) being reachable from peers on
the shared segment; if a join stalls, confirm that port is listening on
`10.10.10.11` inside node 1 (`ss -ltnp` over SSH) and check the joining node's
journal.
